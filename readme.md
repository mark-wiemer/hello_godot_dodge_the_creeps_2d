# Hello Godot: Dodge the Creeps 2D

My first attempt at a Godot game from scratch, following [the official guide](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/01.project_setup.html)

You can play it for free at [markwiemer.itch.io](https://markwiemer.itch.io/dodge-the-creeps-godot-tutorial/)!
